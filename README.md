# Python-Django_2

This project is a Django-based web application that dynamically customizes a poem displayed on a webpage based on the name entered in the URL. When a user inputs a name directly in the URL, the application takes that name and seamlessly integrates it into a predefined poem, personalizing the content for each visitor. The result is a unique and interactive experience where the poem is tailored to reflect the inputted name, making it feel more personal and engaging.


This Django-based web application dynamically personalizes the "Johny Johny" poem displayed on a webpage based on the name entered in the URL. When a user inputs a name directly in the URL, the application seamlessly replaces "Johny" in the poem with the provided name, creating a personalized version of the classic nursery rhyme. For example, if the user enters the name "Jack" in the URL, the poem will be updated to:


Jack Jack, yes Papa,
Eating sugar? No, Papa.
Telling lies? No, Papa.
Open your mouth! Ha, ha, ha!


This project offers an interactive and engaging experience by tailoring the poem to reflect the inputted name.
